## Detailed Walkthrough

### Root
- .gitignore: Ignores node_modules, build outputs, and editor/system files.
- README.md: Project documentation (this file).
- components.json: UI component registry/configuration file (for maintaining consistent component scaffolding or library integration).
- eslint.config.js: Lint rules and configuration to maintain code quality and consistency.
- index.html: Vite entry HTML; defines the root mount point for React.
- package.json / package-lock.json: Project metadata, scripts, and dependency lockfile for reproducible installs.
- tailwind.config.js: Tailwind setup (content paths, theme extensions, plugins).
- vite.config.js: Vite bundler configuration (aliases, plugins, dev server options).
- public/: Static files served at root (e.g., /favicon.ico, images, manifest).

### src (Application Code)
- main.jsx:
  - Bootstraps the React application.
  - Mounts the root component (App) to the DOM element in index.html.
- App.jsx:
  - The main composition layer for routing or page sections.
  - Imports shared components (e.g., Navbar, headers, content sections).
  - Orchestrates the layout and page order for services landing pages.
- index.css:
  - Tailwind directives and global styles.
  - Custom utilities, variables, or base resets if needed.

### src/components (Reusable UI Components)
- AnimatedCounter.jsx:
  - Displays animated numeric counts for KPIs (clients served, projects completed, uptime, etc.).
  - Useful in Hero/Stats sections.
- Button.jsx:
  - Reusable CTA/button with variants and sizes (e.g., primary/secondary).
- DeviceDetectionModal.jsx:
  - Detects device context (mobile/desktop) and informs user for best experience or provides tailored actions.
- FloatingSummary.jsx:
  - A floating panel to summarize key info (e.g., selected services, pricing highlights, or features).
- GlowCard.jsx:
  - Card component with a glow/hover effect; great for showcasing services or features.
- Navbar.jsx:
  - Responsive, possibly sticky navigation with desktop/mobile states.
  - Handles section links and smooth scroll behavior.
- PerformancePanel.jsx:
  - Panel to display performance highlights, metrics, or service guarantees (speed, SEO scores, accessibility).
- TitleHeader.jsx:
  - Consistent, styled section headers with subtitle support.
- models/:
  - Assets or data models used by components (e.g., structured content, icons, or 3D assets if applicable).

### src/sections (Page Sections)
- Contains top-level sections composing your landing page such as:
  - Hero (headline, primary CTA)
  - Services (cards, descriptions)
  - Process/How It Works
  - Portfolio/Case Studies
  - Pricing
  - Testimonials
  - FAQ
  - Contact/CTA
- Each section typically composes shared components and constants for content.

### src/constants (Static Content)
- Central place for:
  - Navigation items (labels and target IDs)
  - Services data (title, description, icon)
  - Pricing tiers and features
  - FAQ questions/answers
  - Social links or contact info

### src/context (Global State with React Context)
- Providers for:
  - Theme (light/dark, system preference)
  - Device or viewport info
  - App state for UI toggles, modals, or selections

### src/styles (Additional Styling)
- Extra CSS files or modules to complement Tailwind when needed.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (LTS recommended, v18+ works well with Vite)
- npm (bundled with Node) or an alternative like pnpm/yarn

Clone and install:
```
git clone https://github.com/shiveshmishra46/WebSolutions-AI.git
cd WebSolutions-AI
npm install
```

Run the dev server:
```
npm run dev
```
- Open the printed local URL (typically http://localhost:5173).
- Vite provides instant HMR (hot module replacement).

Build for production:
```
npm run build
```
- Outputs optimized static assets to dist/.

Preview the production build locally:
```
npm run preview
```

Note: Scripts reflect common Vite defaults. If you adjust script names in package.json, use your updated commands.

---

## Development Workflow

- Code in src/ using React components and Tailwind classes.
- Keep content/data in src/constants to simplify updates.
- Compose the landing experience in src/sections and wire them up in App.jsx.
- Reuse UI pieces from src/components to maintain consistency.
- Manage global app state in src/context when multiple components need shared data.
- Put static images and icons in public/ for direct serving.

Linting:
```
npm run lint
```
Fix lint issues:
```
npm run lint -- --fix
```

Tailwind CSS:
- Add classes directly to JSX.
- Extend theme or add plugins in tailwind.config.js.
- Ensure tailwind.config.js content paths include all JSX/TSX/HTML files to purge unused styles in production.

---

## Build and Deployment

Vercel:
- Import the GitHub repo into Vercel.
- Framework preset: Vite.
- Build command: npm run build
- Output directory: dist

Netlify:
- New site from Git
- Build command: npm run build
- Publish directory: dist

GitHub Pages (Static):
- Build locally or via GitHub Actions.
- Serve the dist/ folder contents via Pages (e.g., from gh-pages branch).

Environment Variables:
- This project is client-first and typically does not require secrets by default.
- If you integrate external APIs, store keys as environment variables and avoid committing them.

---

## Quality and Conventions

- Component Naming: PascalCase for React components (e.g., GlowCard, PerformancePanel).
- File Naming: Match component name to file name.
- CSS: Prefer Tailwind utilities; use src/styles for custom cases.
- Data: Centralize in src/constants to keep components lean.
- Accessibility: Use semantic markup, alt text for images, and keyboard navigable components.
- Performance:
  - Keep components focused and lazy-load heavy sections if needed.
  - Use memoization where appropriate for expensive renders.

---

## Extending the Project

Add a new Section:
1. Create a new file in src/sections (e.g., Testimonials.jsx).
2. Compose it from existing components (TitleHeader, GlowCard, Button).
3. Add data to src/constants if the section is data-driven.
4. Import and place the new section in App.jsx in the desired order.
5. Update navigation data in src/constants to include the new anchor.

Add a new Component:
1. Create a file in src/components (e.g., FeatureCard.jsx).
2. Keep it stateless and reusable; accept props for content and actions.
3. Write basic inline docs (prop descriptions).
4. Add it to your sections as needed.

Update Navbar Links:
- Edit the navigation array in src/constants to add, remove, or reorder links.
- Ensure each target section has a corresponding id for smooth scrolling.

---

## FAQ

- Can I use this as a multi-page app?
  - Yes. Start with React Router or keep it as a polished single-page landing site.
- Does it require a backend?
  - No. It’s a static, client-first site. You can integrate APIs or a backend as needed.
- Can I deploy without Tailwind?
  - Tailwind is deeply integrated. Removing it is possible but not recommended.
