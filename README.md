## Detailed Walkthrough

### Root
- .gitignore: Ignores node_modules, build outputs, and editor/system files.
- README.md: Project documentation (this file).
- components.json: Optional UI component registry/configuration.
- eslint.config.js: Lint rules and configuration.
- index.html: Vite entry HTML; defines the root mount point for React.
- package.json / package-lock.json: Scripts, dependencies, and lockfile.
- tailwind.config.js: Tailwind setup (content paths, theme extensions, plugins).
- vite.config.js: Vite bundler configuration (aliases, plugins, dev server options).
- public/: Static files served at root (e.g., /images, /favicon.ico, manifest). Place PNG fallbacks here (e.g., /images/models/…).

### src (Application Code)
- main.jsx:
  - Bootstraps the React application and mounts App into index.html.
- App.jsx:
  - Main composition layer for the site.
  - Wraps the app in DeviceProvider (context for performance mode).
  - Shows DeviceDetectionModal after a short delay on fresh page loads.
  - Enforces default “balanced” mode on true refresh to favor UX on low-end devices.
  - Renders sections (OptimizedHero/TechStack/Contact, Showcase, Testimonials, etc.).
  - Renders PerformancePanel (user can switch modes from anywhere).

- index.css:
  - Tailwind directives and global styles.

### src/components (Reusable UI Components)
- AnimatedCounter.jsx:
  - Animated numeric counters for KPIs.
- Button.jsx:
  - Reusable CTA/button with variants and sizes.
- DeviceDetectionModal.jsx:
  - Lets user pick mode: “Balanced (Static)” vs “Ultra (3D)”.
  - Calls updatePerformanceMode from DeviceContext.
  - Intended to appear after initial load (see App.jsx).
- FloatingSummary.jsx:
  - Floating panel to summarize key info (e.g., highlights).
- GlowCard.jsx:
  - Card with glow/hover effect; for features/services.
- Navbar.jsx:
  - Responsive navigation; includes mobile profile modal & desktop hover profile.
- PerformancePanel.jsx:
  - Lets users switch between Balanced and Ultra mode at runtime.
  - Sets a sessionStorage flag so the device modal won’t re-open immediately after a manual switch.
- TitleHeader.jsx:
  - Consistent section headers.
- models/:
  - Place 3D helpers or references/assets used for Ultra mode.

### src/sections (Page Sections)
- OptimizedHero.jsx, OptimizedTechStack.jsx, OptimizedContact.jsx:
  - Optimized versions designed to respect performance mode (e.g., static images for Balanced).
- Other sections (Showcase, Featurecards, ExperienceSection, LogoShowcase, Testimonials):
  - Compose shared components and constants for content.

### src/constants (Static Content)
- Navigation items, services data, pricing tiers, FAQs, social/contact info.

### src/context (Global State with React Context)
- DeviceContext.jsx:
  - Exposes performance mode (balanced | ultra) and updatePerformanceMode.
  - Persists choice in localStorage under key performance_mode.

### src/styles
- Additional styling beyond Tailwind (if needed).

## Performance Modes and Low-End Fallbacks

Background:
- Initially, the site used full 3D visuals that ran smoothly on high-end devices but caused lag on low-end devices.
- To prioritize UX over flashy visuals, the app now supports two modes with graceful fallbacks:
  1) Balanced Mode (Static) — default on fresh load
     - Uses static images (PNG/JPG/WebP) instead of heavy 3D.
     - Ensures smooth performance on base/medium segment devices.
  2) Ultra Mode (3D)
     - Enables rich 3D experiences for high/premium devices.

How it works:
- On every fresh page load (true refresh), App.jsx forces “balanced” mode:
  - localStorage.setItem("performance_mode", "balanced")
  - After a 1.5s delay, DeviceDetectionModal prompts the user to select Balanced or Ultra.
- If a user switches mode via PerformancePanel:
  - A session flag sessionStorage.setItem('mode_changed_via_panel', 'true') is used to avoid re-showing the modal immediately on the subsequent render.
- DeviceDetectionModal:
  - Provides two buttons: Balanced (Static) and Ultra (3D).
  - Calls updatePerformanceMode("balanced" | "ultra") from DeviceContext.
- PerformancePanel:
  - Allows changing modes anytime without reloading.

Where to put assets:
- 3D assets/helpers: src/components/models/
- Static fallbacks: public/images/models/ (or another logical path under public/images)

Pattern for conditional rendering in components/sections:
```jsx
import { useDevice } from "../context/DeviceContext";

const ExampleModelBlock = () => {
  const { performanceMode } = useDevice(); // "balanced" | "ultra"

  if (performanceMode === "ultra") {
    return (
      <div className="w-full h-[320px]">
        {/* Render your 3D model viewer/component here */}
        {/* <My3DViewer modelPath="/models/scene.glb" /> */}
      </div>
    );
  }

  // Balanced mode: show static PNG/JPG/WebP fallback
  return (
    <img
      src="/images/models/scene-fallback.png"
      alt="3D preview (static)"
      className="w-full h-auto object-contain"
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
    />
  );
};
```

Implementation tips:
- Keep Ultra mode code-split/lazy-loaded to avoid heavy bundles for Balanced users.
- Keep PNG/WebP fallbacks optimized (use responsive sizes, lazy-load, and caching).
- Test on throttled CPU/Network to validate smoothness.
- Remember: UX > Attractive design; pick Ultra only when hardware can handle it or user explicitly opts in.

Storage keys:
- localStorage: "performance_mode" set to "balanced" or "ultra"
- sessionStorage: "mode_changed_via_panel" = "true" to skip showing DeviceDetectionModal right after a manual switch

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (LTS recommended, v18+ works well with Vite)
- npm (bundled with Node) or an alternative like pnpm/yarn

Clone and install:
```
git clone https://github.com/shiveshmishra46/WebSolutions-AI.git
cd WebSolutions-AI
npm install
```

Run the dev server:
```
npm run dev
```
- Open the printed local URL (typically http://localhost:5173).
- Vite provides instant HMR (hot module replacement).

Build for production:
```
npm run build
```
- Outputs optimized static assets to dist/.

Preview the production build locally:
```
npm run preview
```

---

## Development Workflow

- Code in src/ using React components and Tailwind classes.
- Keep content/data in src/constants to simplify updates.
- Compose the landing experience in src/sections and wire them up in App.jsx.
- Reuse UI pieces from src/components to maintain consistency.
- Manage global app state in src/context when multiple components need shared data.
- Put static images and icons in public/ for direct serving.

Linting:
```
npm run lint
```
Fix lint issues:
```
npm run lint -- --fix
```

Tailwind CSS:
- Add classes directly to JSX.
- Extend theme or add plugins in tailwind.config.js.
- Ensure tailwind.config.js content paths include all JSX/TSX/HTML files to purge unused styles in production.

---

## Build and Deployment

Vercel:
- Import the GitHub repo into Vercel.
- Framework preset: Vite.
- Build command: npm run build
- Output directory: dist

Netlify:
- New site from Git
- Build command: npm run build
- Publish directory: dist

GitHub Pages (Static):
- Build locally or via GitHub Actions.
- Serve the dist/ folder contents via Pages (e.g., from gh-pages branch).

Environment Variables:
- This project is client-first and typically does not require secrets by default.
- If you integrate external APIs, store keys as environment variables and avoid committing them.

---

## Quality and Conventions

- Component Naming: PascalCase for React components (e.g., GlowCard, PerformancePanel).
- File Naming: Match component name to file name.
- CSS: Prefer Tailwind utilities; use src/styles for custom cases.
- Data: Centralize in src/constants to keep components lean.
- Accessibility: Use semantic markup, alt text for images, and keyboard navigable components.
- Performance:
  - Default to Balanced mode on fresh loads.
  - Lazy-load Ultra mode 3D viewers.
  - Use memoization where appropriate for expensive renders.
  - Prefer responsive images and modern formats (WebP/AVIF where possible).

---

## Extending the Project

Add a new Section:
1. Create a new file in src/sections (e.g., Testimonials.jsx).
2. Compose it from existing components (TitleHeader, GlowCard, Button).
3. Add data to src/constants if the section is data-driven.
4. Import and place the new section in App.jsx in the desired order.
5. Update navigation data in src/constants to include the new anchor.

Add a new Component:
1. Create a file in src/components (e.g., FeatureCard.jsx).
2. Keep it stateless and reusable; accept props for content and actions.
3. Write basic inline docs (prop descriptions).
4. Add it to your sections as needed.

Make a component respect performance mode:
1. Import useDevice from context.
2. Read performanceMode.
3. Conditionally render Ultra (3D) vs Balanced (PNG) as shown above.

## Testing and Debugging Tips

- Simulate Low-End Devices:
  - Chrome DevTools → Performance → CPU Throttle (4x/6x).
  - Network Throttle to “Fast 3G/Slow 4G” for image loading checks.
- Force a mode:
  - In console: localStorage.setItem("performance_mode","balanced") or "ultra"
  - Reload; or use the PerformancePanel to toggle.
- Validate modal flow:
  - sessionStorage.removeItem('mode_changed_via_panel'); reload to see DeviceDetectionModal after 1.5s.

---

## FAQ

- Why default to Balanced mode on refresh?
  - To protect UX on unknown/low-end devices and avoid jank.
- Can Ultra mode be enabled automatically based on hardware?
  - You can add heuristics (e.g., hardware concurrency, memory, GPU checks). For now, user choice + panel override is implemented.
- Do I need a backend?
  - No. It’s a static, client-first site. You can integrate APIs as needed.
